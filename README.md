Kibo-RPC
The Kibo Robot Programming Challenge (Kibo-RPC) is an educational program in which
students will solve various problems by moving free-frying robots (Astrobee and Int-Ball)
using their programming skills in a simulation environment and, in the final, in the Japa-
nese Experiment Module (Kibo*) aboard the International Space Station (ISS).
Through interaction with experts in the field of space and the opportunity to observe
their work firsthand, students will be able to deepen their understanding and acquire
specialized scientific knowledge.
Through this educational program, it is our hope students will take the initiative to learn
the techniques and methods involved in programming and robotics, while honing their
STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) skills.
This program is hosted by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in cooperation
with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
*Kibo is pronounced "key-bow" and means "hope" in Japanese.
